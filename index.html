    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Born on 18 Feb 2011 in Nairobi, Kenya. Currently studying at Sukari Presbyterian Junior School.
      I'm extroverted, but I prefer working solo. Self-awareness is my top strength. I can’t swim, but I can beat you in math. 
      Secret button on this website? Yeah, it took 3 weeks 😅😭

    <h2 class="title">Academics</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Let’s be real — most subjects are a snoozefest. Math is goated. English? Only the parts that don’t make you cry. 
      I despise Kiswahili, Social Studies, CRE, Pre-technical Studies, Agriculture, and Kenyan Sign Language.
      After school, I only do what I find interesting — read cool stuff, have actual convos with teachers and parents, and just do me.

    <h2 class="title">Leadership & Clubs</h2>
    <p class="content">
      I’ve been runner-up for head boy — twice. Captain of the chess club and table tennis squad. 
      I lead with commitment to the arts and that spontaneous push that hits when you're least expecting it.

    <p class="content">

    <h2 class="title">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p class="content">
      I play the piano and love video games (especially Bedwars). I’m into Forrest Frank’s music and my favorite show right now? Death Note — peak fiction.

    <h2 class="title">Projects</h2>
    <p class="content">
      I’ve built a password generator, a stopwatch, a working clock, a to-do app (which I'm particularly proud of), and a few other neat things. 
      There's also a secret button somewhere here... 👀
